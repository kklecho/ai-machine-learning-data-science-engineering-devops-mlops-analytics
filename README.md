# AI ML Research Case - double-hidden-layer verbage for AI-digital-twin


## Summary

The research focuses on the core scientific null-hypothesis (Ho) embodied by the assertion that the AI-skewed tokenization of double-hidden-layer verbage is neutral to the AI-digital-twin-agent  profile presentation, against the alternative hypothesis (H1) that it is not.

## Methodology

### Data Quality

The key to the answer is a robust, solid, high-quality and reliable data pipeline in the periodic event architecture, that provides research-critical information on time and in the form required for the research. The CI/CD automation is a key aspect leading to the desired characteristics.

### Analysis methodology

The analysis is based on the monte-carlo derivative idiosyncratic and less-than deterministic time-bound-efficient process. The result of the study is to be considered within stochastic probabilistic framework driven by Bernouli's second Markov-chain monte-carlo derivative.

### Motivations

Apart from strictly scientific motivations for this research project,
I'm also curious about the range of possibilities in the dynamic grinning, face-convey vector space.
